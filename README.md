# discord-userful-calculation-bot
Discord bot witten by discord.js v13 and mathjs for advanced calculations. You can use [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to make it work.<br>
**Anyone can copy and use this code.**<br>
### Japanese explanation [here](https://note.com/otoneko1102/n/n10987618eae5).
## AD
My discord bot invite link [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1108178870429036686&permissions=412384488512&scope=bot) written with this code.<br>
Please add bot to your Discord serverüôèüôè
## TO DO
Replace `px` in config.js with your own.<br>
Invite your bot to at least one Discord server(Because events/ready.js will throw error).<br>
_If the version of the NPM package in this code is low, it is recommended to use the latest version._<br>
Use the following GS code to permanently run Glitch with [GAS (Google Apps Script)](https://script.google.com/).
```js
/*
Paste this code into GAS.
After that, please execute it once and allow the access authority etc.
Set the GAS timer at 5 minute intervals and run it.
*/

var GLITCH_PROJECT_NAME = "" // Enter your Glitch project name here.
var GLITCH_URL = `https://${GLITCH_PROJECT_NAME}.glitch.me`;
function wakeGlitch(){
 var json = {
   'type':'wake'
 };
 sendGlitch(GLITCH_URL, json);
}
function sendGlitch(uri, json){
 var params = {
   'contentType' : 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
   'method' : 'post',
   'payload' : json,
   'muteHttpExceptions': true
 };
 response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(uri, params);
}

```
### ‚ö†WARNING‚ö†
If you try to import this repository and use it in Glitch before 07/26/2023, you may encounter an error. If so, import it again.
### I have no plans to create a project with the same functionality in discord.js v14.
